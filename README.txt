Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

	The easiest one which we will probably use as a starting point for all testing

	There are two versions: One with reverb and delay and one without it. This is to test how reverb affect 	the pitch detection


Moonlight Sonata

	This is rendered out of Ableton Live using a midi file, so it should be very uniform in its output and 	easy for the program to process

	Three versions: Left hand only, right hand only, and full

	Will be most useful for testing how well the program can discern harmony


Concertio de Aranjuez (Solo Guitar) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHVAyeRTf00]

	This is audio from a guitarist playing it live; will be useful for testing on less robotic samples

	Strummed chords will be hard for the markov model to generate states from, this is a potential point of 	failure we should pay attention to
